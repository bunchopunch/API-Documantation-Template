API Documantation Template
==========================

An example of Github Wiki containing API documentation. This is meant to be used as a template for documanting an API, or as an excersise for helping to think out API details. Well this template is probably best fit for REST style APIs, feel free to modify it however you see fit.

To get see how this template is laid out, take a look at the [API Documantation Template Wiki](https://github.com/bunchopunch/API-Documantation-Template/wiki). However, keep in mind that nothing in this template is required and that some peices may not even make sense in the context of certain APIs.

All of that said, if you're new to documenting APIs, have a large API, or are looking for a long term solution, be aware that something like this may not be the ideal. Investigating projects such as [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) and [I/O Docs.](http://www.mashery.com/product/io-docs) may be prove to be worthwhile.
